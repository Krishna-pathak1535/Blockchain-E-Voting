# **Blockchain E-Voting Done Right: Privacy and Transparency with Public Blockchain** 

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Blockchain E-Voting Done Right** project! This project aims to **revolutionize electronic voting systems** using the power of **public blockchain technology**. By leveraging **Ethereum**, **cryptography**, and **machine learning**, this project ensures **privacy**, **security**, and **transparency** in the voting process.

### **Key Features of the System:**
- **Biometric Voter Authentication** using **face recognition** powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **OpenCV**.
- **Blockchain-Secured Voting Ledger** utilizing **Ethereum**, **SHA-256**, and **zk-SNARKs** for **data integrity** and **privacy**.
- **Smart Contracts** to automate **real-time vote validation** and eliminate errors in the process.
- **Homomorphic Encryption** for securely counting votes without revealing the vote itself.
- **Machine Learning** to detect **fraudulent voting patterns** (using **RNN**, **SVM**, and **K-Means**).
- **Admin & User Dashboards** for **easy management** of candidates, parties, and vote tracking.
- **Remote Voting** with **audit trail verification** ensuring complete transparency and accessibility.

## **Why This Project?**

The traditional voting systems face issues related to **voter fraud**, **lack of transparency**, and **centralized control**. By integrating **blockchain**, this project provides a **decentralized**, **tamper-proof** system for secure elections that can be **remotely accessed**. This ensures that each vote is valid and counted correctly, **preserving voter anonymity** while ensuring **real-time verification** of the results.
