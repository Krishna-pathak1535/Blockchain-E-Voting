## **🔍 Why This Project?**

The goal of this project was to address the key issues in traditional voting systems. These include **lack of transparency**, **voter fraud**, **centralized control**, and **privacy**. By using **blockchain**, we built a **secure, decentralized** platform that allows votes to be cast **remotely**, while ensuring that each vote is **transparent** and **immutable**. The **blockchain ledger** ensures that no vote can be tampered with, and **cryptographic techniques** like **homomorphic encryption** preserve **privacy** throughout the process.
